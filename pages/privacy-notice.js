<p><br></p>
<p>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Short:&nbsp;We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>
<p>Consent.&nbsp;We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Legitimate Interests.

<p>In legal terms, we are generally the &apos;data controller&apos; under European data protection laws of the personal information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a &apos;data processor&apos; on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the &apos;data controller&apos; responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers&apos; privacy practices, you should read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.</p>

<p>6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>In Short:&nbsp;If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider.

No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we can not promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:boooking1app@gmail.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">boooking1app@gmail.com</a> .</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
<p><br></p>
